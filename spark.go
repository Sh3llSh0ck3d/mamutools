 *
 * A sparkline is a very small line chart, typically drawn without axes or
 * coordinates. It presents the general shape of the variation (typically over
 * time) in some measurement, such as temperature or stock market price, in a
 * simple and highly condensed way. Sparklines are small enough to be embedded
 * in text, or several sparklines may be grouped together as elements of a small
 * multiple.
 *
 * Whereas the typical chart is designed to show as much data as possible, and
 * is set off from the flow of text, sparklines are intended to be succinct,
 * memorable, and located where they are discussed.
 *
 * PS. All credits go to @holman by its original implementation in Bash.
